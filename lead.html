            <h3><br>Co-President & Executive Board Member | <a href="https://cdssatcu.com">Columbia Data Science Society</a></h3>
            <h4>November 2021 – Present</h4>
            <p>I co-organize data science related events, technical workshops, and career panels for undergraduate and graduate students at Columbia. This past year, we held the society’s 8th annual data science hackathon, sponsored by Hudson River Trading, bringing together 161 Columbia students to develop innovative data science projects in the topics of patient safety, data privacy, and gaming. I also worked on our annual Women in Data Science program for the past two years which connects around 30 female-identifying students with 5 industry professionals through mentorship, networking events, and career workshops.  </p>
            
            <h3>Student Researcher | <a href="https://barnard.edu/scholars-of-distinction"> Barbara Horowitz '55 Scholars of Distinction Program</a></h3>
            <h4>Sepember 2021 – Present</h4>
            <p>I was selected as 1 of 5 first-year students to pursue a fully-funded research project with the assistance of faculty mentorship, project development seminars, and off-campus events. My project involves a photography collection and a showcase of Indo-Fijian oral histories. As a descendant of Indo-Fijian indentured laborers, I want to bring more Indo-Fijian oral histories and lived experiences into academic research and knowledge on indentured labor in Fiji. </p>
            
            <h3>Vocalist & Public Relations Chair | <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/sur/">Columbia Sur</a></h3>
            <h4>September 2021 – September 2022</h4>
            <p>Sur is Columia's premier South Asian a capella group that performs at numerous on and off campus events. We arrange and perform fusion music to celebrate South Asian cultures and art-forms. As the Public Relations Chair, I curated social media content to promote our performances and events to the Columbia community.</p>
